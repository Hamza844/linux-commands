# Git commands
Make sure you are in the directory of the cloned repository!

Also make sure the cloned repository is yours!
If not, there will be an error message:

> $ git push origin \
remote: Permission to \<other-user-name>/\<repo-name>.git denied to \<your-name>. \
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/<other-user-name\>/\<repo-name>/': The requested URL returned error: 403

## Make a directory git repository
[A new repo from an existing project](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/init.html)
```sh
$git init
$git add *
$git commit
```

## Clone a repository
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67699/how-to-clone-all-remote-branches-in-git

`$git clone https://github.com/<user-name>/<repo-name>.git`

To clone into a specific directory:

`$git clone https://github.com/<user-name>/<repo-name>.git <directory>`

If you want to clone all branches, it already does it for you.
You can check it with:

`$git branch -a`

And to start work on one branch, just:

`$git checkout <branch-name>`

## Just clone a folder from a repository
[How do I clone a subdirectory only of a Git repository?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/600079/how-do-i-clone-a-subdirectory-only-of-a-git-repository)

```bash
$mkdir <repo>
$cd <repo>
$git init
$git remote add -f origin <url>
$git config core.sparseCheckout true
$echo "some/dir/" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
$git pull origin master
```

## Synchronize local repo with remote one
[git: sync local repo with remote one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6373277/git-sync-local-repo-with-remote-one)

```bash
git fetch --prune #-p, --prune: After fetching, remove any remote-tracking branches which no longer exist on the remote.
git checkout <branch-name> #if there are new branches
```

If the commands above do not work, try: 

```sh
git pull
```

## List all branch and get current branch name
`$git branch`

## Create a branch

`$git checkout master` Make sure you are in master branch every time you create a branch!!

`$git checkout -b <branch-name>` -b for create

`$git push origin <branch-name>` Push the branch from local to remote

## Rename a branch
[How do I rename a local Git branch?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6591213/how-do-i-rename-a-local-git-branch)

`$git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>`

## Switch to another branch
`$git checkout <branch-name>`

## Delete a branch
```sh
$git checkout master
$git branch -d <branch-name>
$git push origin :<branch-name>
```

## Recover a deleted branch
[Can I recover a branch after its deletion in Git?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3640764/can-i-recover-a-branch-after-its-deletion-in-git)

```sh
# use this command to find the SHA1 for the commit at the tip of your deleted branch
git reflog
git checkout -b <deleted-branch-name> <sha>
```

## List commits of a branch since its creation from `master`
```sh
git log master...<branch-name>
```

## Just clone a branch of a repo
```sh
$git clone -b <branch-name> https://github.com/<user-name>/<repo-name>.git
```

## Fork and then create a pull request
Follow the instructions here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/

## Apply unmerged pull request to own fork
[How to apply unmerged upstream pull requests from other forks into my fork?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6022302/how-to-apply-unmerged-upstream-pull-requests-from-other-forks-into-my-fork)
1. If you don't want it to be merged to your master branch, first create a new branch
2. Go to the webpage of the branch from other fork(which is the branch you want to apply)
3. Select `New Pull Request`
4. Choose the correct repo name and branch name
5. Click `Create Pull Request`
6. Merge the pull request

## Add folders or files, commit, and then push(Git doesn't allow you to commit empty folders, the workaround is to add .gitkeep file into them)
```sh
$git add <folder-or-file-name>
$git commit
$git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Add empty folders
[How can I add an empty directory to a Git repository?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/115983/how-can-i-add-an-empty-directory-to-a-git-repository)

Just add `.gitignore` in that empty folder, so GitHub will keep it.

## Delete files and then commit
Ref : [Removing multiple files from a Git repo that have already been deleted from disk](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/492558/removing-multiple-files-from-a-git-repo-that-have-already-been-deleted-from-disk)
```sh
$git add -u :/
$git commit
$git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Reset your \<branch-name> in forked repository
```sh
$git remote add upstream <the-url-of-upstream-repo>
$git fetch upstream
$git checkout <branch-name>
$git reset --hard upstream/master
$git push origin <branch-name> --force #--force solves non-fast-forward error
```

## Undo `git remote add upstream`
```sh
$git remote rm upstream
```

## Sync your forked repository
```sh
$git remote add upstream <the-url-of-upstream-repo>
$git fetch upstream
$git checkout master
$git merge upstream/master
$git push origin master
```

## Sync a branch with master branch
```sh
$git pull origin <branch-name>
$git checkout <branch-name>
$git merge master
$git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Merge a local branch \<branch-feature> into another local branch \<branch-base>
```sh
$git checkout <branch-base>
$git merge <branch-feature>
$git push origin <branch-base>
```
If met with the problem `merge: <branch-feature> - not something we can merge`, try `$git checkout <branch-feature>` and then repeat the commands above.

## Pull a specific branch from remote to local
```sh
$git pull origin <branch-name>
```

## Rebase a branch to origin
```sh
$git fetch
$git rebase master
$git pull origin <branch-name> # to solve non-fast-forward error
$git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Import a repository(This is a hack to fork a repo but detach their dependency)
```
Click on the '+' sign on the upper right corner of Github webpage(next to your avatar)
Click on "Import repository"
In "Your old repositoryâ€™s clone URL", paste the url of repo you want to import
Give it a new name and click "Begin import"
After the process is done, Github will send you a email confirming with that
```

## Revert a commit
(This will create a new commit)
`$git revert <sha-of-a-commit>`

## Revert multiple commits to a specific point
(This won't create new commit, it just remove the specific commits)
```sh
$git checkout <branch-name>
$git reset --hard <sha-of-a-commit>
$git push origin <branch-name> --force
```

## Compare two branches
`$git diff <branch-name1>...<branch-name2>`

## Check git branch graph
`$git log --oneline --graph`

## Compare commits
[Comparing commits](https://help.github.com/en/articles/comparing-commits-across-time#comparing-commits)

First find out the SHA codes of the two commits, and then open `https://github.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/compare/<commit_sha1>..<commit_sha2>` in the browser.

## Add equation into Github README.md
[How to show math equations in general github's markdown(not github's blog)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11256433/how-to-show-math-equations-in-general-githubs-markdownnot-githubs-blog)

Write your equation in [iTex2Img](http://www.sciweavers.org/free-online-latex-equation-editor), find its url, and then add the following into your README.md:
```
![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?<somewhere_link_to_your_image>)
```
