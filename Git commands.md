# Git commands
Make sure you are in the directory of the cloned repository!

## Clone a repository
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67699/how-to-clone-all-remote-branches-in-git

`$git clone https://github.com/<user-name>/<repo-name>.git`

If you want to clone all branches, it already does it for you.
You can check it with:

`git branch -a`

And to start work on one branch, just:

`git checkout <branch-name>`

## List all branch and get current branch name
`$git branch`

## Create a branch

`$git checkout master` Make sure you are in master branch every time you create a branch!!

`$git checkout -b <branch-name>` -b for create

`$git push origin <branch-name>` Push the branch from local to remote

## Switch to another branch
`$git checkout <branch-name>`

## Delete a branch
```sh
$git checkout master
$git branch -d <branch-name>
$git push origin :<branch-name>
```

## List commits of a branch since its creation from `master`
```sh
git log master...<branch-name>
```

## Just clone a branch of a repo
```sh
$git clone -b <branch-name> https://github.com/<user-name>/<repo-name>.git
```

## Fork and then create a pull request
Follow the instructions here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/

## Add folders or files, commit, and then push(Git doesn't allow you to commit empty folders, the workaround is to add .gitkeep file into them)
```sh
$git add <folder-or-file-name>
$git commit
$git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Reset your \<branch-name> in forked repository
```sh
$git remote add upstream <the-url-of-upstream-repo>
$git fetch upstream
$git checkout <branch-name>
$git reset --hard upstream/master
$git push origin <branch-name> --force #--force solves non-fast-forward error
```

## Sync your forked repository
```sh
$git remote add upstream <the-url-of-upstream-repo>
$git fetch upstream
$git checkout master
$git merge upstream/master
$git push origin master
```

## Sync a branch with master branch
```sh
$git pull origin <branch-name>
$git checkout <branch-name>
$git merge master
$git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Merge a local branch \<branch-feature> into another local branch \<branch-base>
```sh
$git checkout <branch-base>
$git merge <branch-feature>
$git push origin <branch-base>
```
If met with the problem `merge: <branch-feature> - not something we can merge`, try `$git checkout <branch-feature>` and then repeat the commands above.

## Rebase a branch to origin
```sh
$git fetch
$git rebase master
$git pull origin <branch-name> # to solve non-fast-forward error
$git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Import a repository(This is a hack to fork a repo but detach their dependency)
```
Click on the '+' sign on the upper right corner of Github webpage(next to your avatar)
Click on "Import repository"
In "Your old repositoryâ€™s clone URL", paste the url of repo you want to import
Give it a new name and click "Begin import"
After the process is done, Github will send you a email confirming with that
```

## Revert a commit
(This will create a new commit)
`$git revert <sha-of-a-commit>`

## Revert multiple commits to a specific point
(This won't create new commit, it just remove the specific commits)
```sh
$git checkout <branch-name>
$git reset --hard <sha-of-a-commit>
$git push origin <branch-name> --force
```

## Compare two branches
`$git diff <branch-name1>...<branch-name2>`
