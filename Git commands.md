2. Go to the webpage of the branch from other fork(which is the branch you want to apply)
3. Select `New Pull Request`
4. Choose the correct repo name and branch name
5. Click `Create Pull Request`
6. Merge the pull request

```sh
$git add <folder-or-file-name>
$git commit
$git push origin <branch-name>
```

[Changes not staged for commit even after git add](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36291216/changes-not-staged-for-commit-even-after-git-add)

If got `Changes not staged for commit` even after using `git add`, one can try change to the specific folder and then use `git add` again.

```

## Add empty folders
[How can I add an empty directory to a Git repository?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/115983/how-can-i-add-an-empty-directory-to-a-git-repository)

Just add `.gitignore` in that empty folder, so GitHub will keep it.

## Make .gitignore take effect
[.gitignore is ignored by Git](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11451535/gitignore-is-ignored-by-git)

```sh
$git rm -r --cached .
$git add .

```

Create `<project root>/.git/info/attributes` and then add into the file:
```sh
*.cpp filter=gitignore
```

Use `git config` to define the filter named `gitignore`:

```sh
git config --global filter.gitignore.clean "sed  '/View.*\(.*\);/d'"
git config --global filter.gitignore.smudge cat
```

## Untrack files
[Untrack files from git temporarily](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6964297/untrack-files-from-git-temporarily)

## Unstage files
[Why are there two ways to unstage a file in Git?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6919121/why-are-there-two-ways-to-unstage-a-file-in-git)
```sh
git reset -- <filePath>
```
Then you can see when using `git commit`, the file or folder moves from `Changes to be committed` part to `Changes not staged for commit` part.

## Delete files and then commit
Ref : [Removing multiple files from a Git repo that have already been deleted from disk](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/492558/removing-multiple-files-from-a-git-repo-that-have-already-been-deleted-from-disk)
```sh
$git add -u :/
$git commit
$git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Reset your \<branch-name> in forked repository
```sh
$git remote add upstream <the-url-of-upstream-repo>
$git fetch upstream
$git checkout <branch-name>
$git reset --hard upstream/master
$git push origin <branch-name> --force #--force solves non-fast-forward error
```

## Undo `git remote add upstream`
```sh
$git remote rm upstream
```

## `fatal: remote origin already exists.`
```sh
$git remote rm origin
```

## Sync your forked repository
```sh
$git remote add upstream <the-url-of-upstream-repo>
$git fetch upstream
$git checkout master
$git merge upstream/master
$git push origin master
```

## Sync a branch with master branch
```sh
$git pull origin <branch-name>
$git checkout <branch-name>
$git merge master
$git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Merge a local branch \<branch-feature> into another local branch \<branch-base>
```sh
$git checkout <branch-base>
$git merge <branch-feature>
$git push origin <branch-base>
```
If met with the problem `merge: <branch-feature> - not something we can merge`, try `$git checkout <branch-feature>` and then repeat the commands above.

If there is a conflict:
```
Auto-merging xxx.cpp
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in xxx.cpp
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
Then edit the `xxx.cpp` to resolve the conflicts, and then:
```sh
$git add xxx.cpp
$git commit
```

## Undo merge
[Undo a Git merge that hasn't been pushed yet](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2389361/undo-a-git-merge-that-hasnt-been-pushed-yet)
```sh
# find out the commit just prior to the merge, get its sha
$git reflog
# reset
$git reset --hard <sha-of-a-commit>
```

## Pull a specific branch from remote to local
```sh
$git pull origin <branch-name>
```

## Rebase a branch to origin
```sh
$git fetch
$git rebase master
$git pull origin <branch-name> # to solve non-fast-forward error
$git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Import a repository(This is a hack to fork a repo but detach their dependency)
```
Click on the '+' sign on the upper right corner of Github webpage(next to your avatar)

```

## Revert a commit
(This will create a new commit)
`$git revert <sha-of-a-commit>`

## Revert multiple commits to a specific point
(This won't create new commit, it just remove the specific commits)
```sh
$git checkout <branch-name>
$git reset --hard <sha-of-a-commit>
$git push origin <branch-name> --force
```
